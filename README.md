# hcloud-terraria

>this is currently WIP, come back in a week when 1.4 is live

jus a lil' bit of code to setup a terraria server using the following:

- hetzner/hcloud: for vserver
- namecheap: for dns
- terraform: for provisioning infra
- ansible: for configuration

> sorry for not being able to provide in-depth documentation for this i just threw this together in an hour, so i recommend **not using this unless you know what you're doing**

have nice day!
